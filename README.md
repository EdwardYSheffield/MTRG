Identifying patients from a large number of people by a small number of tests

2020.03.02
Presently, an epidemic is threatening public health.
This small work is beyond our research areas, and completed in a hurry without extensive literature review.
Although the approach is proposed independently, we find soon that similar ideas has already been introduced in some existing literatures.
Those works are mainly focused on mathematical aspect, while our study is mainly focused on algorithm procedure.
Thereby, this study has to be treated as an application, generelization and minor modification of existing knowledge only.
But, it seems this type of procedure has great potential on the improvement of testing efficiency of diseases.
So we build a simple program using Python (besides the experimental Matlab program), which gives recommended number of sub-groups.
We wish this simple work could be a reminder and a tool to public, especially those who are fighting against epidemic.
