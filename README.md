Identifying patients from a large number of people by a small number of tests

Presently, a pandemic is threatening public health.
Limited by the time, we did not investigate literatures extensively.
Instead, we focused on the application and effectiveness of this approach. Wish it helps somehow.

The early edition of this work was published here:

2020.05.15 update: we further propose to apply pool tests to mask bins, i.e., the trash bins for collecting masks only.

2020.05.26 update: further discuss the advantages of the above strategy: making masks more useful, further saving resources for pool tests, efficient monitoring and control of pandemic, avoiding pollution caused by used masks. (Using this strategy, testing/screening is performed without explicit sampling from people's body)
